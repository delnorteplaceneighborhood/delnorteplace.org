The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association is a registered association with the City of Phoenix Neighborhood Services Department. We are recognized as one of approximately 230 official associations in the area, and receive invaluable support services from several city departments-- which in turn, helps us help you!

We are a very active non-dues association and hold monthly meetings where we discuss a wide range of neighborhood and community issues. We also host social events throughout the year. 

All Del Norte Place neighbors, both owners and renters, are welcome to participate.
