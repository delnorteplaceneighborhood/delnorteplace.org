# Welcome to your new neighborhood, Del Norte Place! 

We are happy you purchased a home in our lovely, historic neighborhood. Attached, you will find a
description of your home according to records obtained by citizens who worked
on achieving historic designation for Del Norte. This compilation of information
was done in the early 90’s. It’s fun to see when homes were built, who were the
original owners, who built the house and what is the architectural style of your
home. We hope this information will be interesting to you and helpful when you
decide to make improvements on your home.

Many of us have made changes to our homes over the years, as we strive to keep
our homes well maintained. According to the City of Phoenix planning
department, any exterior changes that require a building permit must go through
the Historic Preservation Office for review. This exterior work would include
remodeling, new construction, alterations or relocation of a building or structure.
These are all commonsense strategies for homeowners and neighborhood
services to ensure that modifications are in keeping with the historic character of
the area. If you have any specific questions, you can always call the Historic
Preservation Office at 602-261-8699.

As part of [this packet](/welcome/Welcome-to-Del-Norte-Place.zip), you’ll find an application for the tax exemption for
residents. This is one of the many benefits to living here! We hope you enjoy
your new home and that you are able to take part in community events in Del
Norte. It is a friendly and welcoming community. We’re happy you chose our
neighborhood!

The Del Norte Historic Preservation Committee.
