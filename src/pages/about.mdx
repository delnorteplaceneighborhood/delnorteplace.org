**History:** The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association has been registered with the City of Phoenix since 1993. Recorded documents show that the Del Norte Place Neighborhood Improvement Association was the active body prior to that circa 1950’s. The board members of the association in the 1990’s were responsible for gathering and organizing all of the historic information necessary in order to get Del Norte Place listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After much grand effort their hard work came to fruition and Del Norte Place officially received its Historic Designation December 21, 1994. The Association did many incredible things from 1990-2000’s including receiving a Block Watch Grant Award which gave them the funds needed to install poles and alley lights. The Association also held home tours open to the residents only and grand holiday parties at the Norton House. They created newsletters, organized Easter egg hunts and potlucks and managed to work together whether they were formalized or volunteer. The structure of the association seemed to work best with whatever the neighborhood was most comfortable with. Sometimes formal with elected officers and sometimes less formal. By- Laws were implemented for a few years in 1997 and then no longer followed in the 2000’s. Eventually the active participants left the association and the association remained dormant after 2014.

**History of Present Day Association**: The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association was revived in 2018. 
Destyn Moreno moved into her home in January 2018 at 2520 N 15th Ave and fell in love with the beauty and hometown feel of the neighborhood. 
As a lover of historic homes she used her skillset to research the neighborhood history.
She met and spoke to neighbors who shared stories of how the neighborhood used to come together and celebrate and she decided it would be a wonderful idea to bring the neighborhood association back to life.
In later 2018 she started forming a small group of interested residents and they met at her home monthly.
In order to grow the small group she decided to host a coffee social where she hired Luana’s coffee cart and invited the entire neighborhood to come have a free coffee and meet their neighbors. 
It was a success! The group grew and voluntarily organized with Destyn Moreno as President, and Heather Finden as Secretary. 
The group consisted of past Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association Board Members, new residents and long term residents. 
The group began working together planning social events, organizing newsletters, and organizing meetings to accommodate for more participants. 
In 2019 the group decided to officially reactivate the association registration with the City Of Phoenix so that they could apply for a Block Watch Grant. 
In September of 2019 Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association once again became an active registered Association with the City of Phoenix with Destyn Moreno as Primary Lead.
The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association is officially recognized by the City of Phoenix as an official neighborhood association.

Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association is a very active non-dues association and holds monthly meetings where we discuss a wide range of neighborhood and community issues. We host social events, annual Del Norte Place birthday party at the Norton House in April, holiday events, lawn social gatherings (residents and board members taking turns hosting), charity drives, garage sales, food drives and more throughout the year. All Del Norte Place neighbors, both owners and renters are welcome to participate. The association also supports private residents who have formed groups including, trap-neuter-release to control our stray cat population, water conservation group, walking group, birthday party announcements and various others.

**WHO WE ARE**: The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association has 3 officers and over 16 active members, including Block Watch Captains, that are all volunteers.
The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association (DNPNA) structure was formed under the advice from past board members, 1990s-early 2000’s, to remain volunteer officer positions consisting of President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer, and most recently Member at Large. 

Currently, Destyn Moreno is President, Shannon Land acting VP and current Member at Large, and Ian Cleary Secretary and website coordinator. Past secretary and DNPNA newsletter editor was Heather Finden (2019- October 2021). 
The association does not currently incorporate bylaws, but is organized, active and follows past association vision. 
The VP position and Treasurer position are currently open and seeking volunteers to fill those positions.

DNPNA has official committees too.
Currently we have the Historic Preservation Committee with 2 members (Fran Eyrich, Shannon Land) and seeking more interested residents.
The Welcome Committee consists of 2 members (Jeanne Kainec, Destyn Moreno) and is seeking more volunteers. 

Our DNP website consists of 3 members for IT, content and design (alphabetically, Ian Cleary, Joel Gillies, Shannon Land). The Events Committee is currently seeking volunteers. 
Our Block Watch Grant Committee consists of 2 members, (Brain Wixom, Destyn Moreno). 
DNPNA also participates in the City Of Phoenix Neighborhood Block Watch Program. 
We currently have 12 volunteer Block Watch Captains, 1-2 for each block and are seeking a volunteer for 1600 Encanto Blvd Block. 
The Block Watch Captains hold quarterly meetings led by our Community Action Officer, Ben Harris. 
(Peter Conden, Randy Schiller 1500 Block Virginia, Fran Eyrich 1600 Block Virginia, Mandel Moreno 1500 Block Wilshire, Kelly Blake 1600 Block Wilshire, Paul McGinn 1500 Block Lewis, Jodie Snyder 1600 Block Lewis, Joel Gillies 1500 Block Vernon, Heather Finden 1600 Block Vernon, Modena Watson 1500 Encanto and temporary 1600 Block Encanto)

**WHAT WE DO**: Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association holds monthly in person/hybrid zoom meetings at the Encanto Golf Tavern the 3rd Thursday of the month from 6-7 PM and is open to all residents.
The Encanto Tavern works in conjunction with DNPNA and holds the facility open to us during this time exclusively.
There is a 5:30 social before the meetings to allow for residents to get some dinner. We invite City Officials to attend our meetings, including our Community Action Officer with the City of Phoenix Police Department.
Our past guests have included Vice Mayor Laura Pastor, City of Phoenix Historic Preservation Officers, Arizona State Historic Preservation Officers, City Manager Officials, City of Phoenix Public Works Officials, Park Rangers, City of Phoenix Park Managers, Phoenix Historic Neighborhood Coalition Officers,

 historic neighborhood leads, and our City of Phoenix Neighborhood Services Division Officer. We encourage residents to make suggestions for other guest speakers and topics of discussion as well. The DNPNA Board meets the first week of every month to discuss and organize the monthly meeting agenda.
DNPNA communicates monthly announcements, provides meeting schedules with agendas and minutes, coordinates special neighborhood events and community events and distributes the City of Phoenix Neighborhood Services Division monthly newsletters etc. via email for those that subscribe.
This information is also disseminated via posts on NextDoor through the Del Norte Place groups exclusively, and via flier for special events. 
We also have volunteers that will notify by phone or doorstep upon request for those that do not use digital communications. 
DNPNA has put together a web site [DelNortePlace.org](https://DelNortePlace.org) where you can find the history of Del Norte Place, board member information, accomplishments, and current and past events. 
Residents may also submit information, articles of interest , suggestions and photos through the website. 
We are currently working on a resident portal for access to archived meeting minutes and other historical documents. 
We also offer a way to subscribe with an opt-in/out option to the DNPNA email list if you have not already been subscribed. 
DNPNA is an active association within the community at large as well. 
City projects affecting the neighborhood are addressed by our DNPNA Officers and other active residents and challenged so as to protect and preserve the historic nature of our neighborhood.
DNPNA officers, members and interested residents attend City hearings affecting our neighborhoods both on a local as well as State level.
DNPNA works closely with the City of Phoenix Historic Preservation Office and Phoenix Historic Neighborhood Coalition when any situation arises that may affect our historic designation, such as demolitions of contributing homes, non-permitted exterior work and other issues that threaten the historic integrity of our neighborhood.
DNPNA also offers other historic neighborhoods support when the need arises and stays in communication with other historic neighborhood leads.

**WHAT WE HAVE DONE**: DNPNA was awarded a 2020 Block Watch Grant in June 2021 which afforded us the lovely green signs posted throughout our neighborhood on lawns and alley caps. 
Heather Finden (past DNPNA Secretary), Brian Wixom (Block Watch Grant Coordinator) and Destyn Moreno (DNPNA President) and various residents that attend DNPNA meetings were responsible for organizing this Grant.
These signs were designed by our BWG members and Block Watch Captain (Mandel Moreno), and purchased with the Block Watch Grant Fund Award we received in 2020.
Included in the 2020 Block Watch Grant Award were funds to go towards the Alley Light Dusk to Dawn program.
Residents are currently working on installation processes for alley lights adjacent to ROW of their property and anyone interested can contact the DNPNA Block Watch Grant committee members for more information.
[Destynmoreno@gmail.com](mailto:DestynMoreno@gmail.com) or [Brianwixom@gmail.com](mailto:Brianwixom@gmail.com).
DNPNA applied in November 2021 for the 2021 Block Watch Grant which is in process and we will be informed of any award by June 2022.

Some accomplishments that the DNPNA has challenged and successfully overcome since 2019 are:
- Wanrack Telecom Fiber Optic Line (2020) for the Franklin School would have caused aggressive and destructive boring under private property along 15th Ave, Encanto Blvd and 17th Ave. Due to the challenge, it was redesigned and moved away from private property and placed under 15th Ave, Encanto and 17th Ave.
- Small Wireless Installations on or near private property in historic designated neighborhoods (2021-2022).
- Challenging a demolition permit of a contributing home to be turned into a parking lot on Encanto Blvd which will affect our historic designation as well as traffic safety and nuisance issues (2022- ongoing).
- Working with other historic district neighborhoods to reduce speeds along 15th Ave (2021- present).
- Collaborating with neighborhoods across the state and within our historic districts challenging State and local zoning change legislation (HB2674) that would have taken our current zoning protections away (2022).
- Recognized as outstanding Neighborhood Association for 2020 at Vice Mayor Pastor’s Celebration Breakfast (Sept 2021).
- Block Watch Grant Award awarded June 2021. - Block Watch Grant Award awarded June 2022.
  
A Vision from 1990: Del Norte Place was created in April, 1927 and has survived and prospered for over *95 years of existence, Del Norte Place has a strong sense of community, long term friendships, and residents dedicated to their homes. Although the neighborhood has not been threatened with developers seeking to demolish its homes for high-rises or other commercial uses, residents today know that with the burgeoning City, vigilance is needed. Wanting Del Norte Place to remain an oasis, a refuge from the bustle, and little bit storybook, homeowners organized the Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association.” -Excerpt from Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association Handbook. *Updated from 64
