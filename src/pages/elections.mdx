# Dear Del Norte Place Neighbors:

We would like to thank all who attended the May 26th DNPNA Special Session meeting for your participation and your comments.

This meeting provided the Del Norte Place neighborhood residents an opportunity to participate in a vote "for" or "against" elections for association officers. 

The majority of those in attendance at the meeting voted for elections. At this time the Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association board is calling for candidates.

The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association board would like to thank all participants for their interest and commitment to the association and wish them the best of luck.
