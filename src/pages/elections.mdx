# <u>Disclaimers</u>

1. The candidate bios have been cut and pasted as written. The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association is not responsible for claims made by the candidates. 

2. A word about Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association as a “volunteer” association:

A petition that was circulated in April and May (to select residents) requesting elections stated, *"For the last four years, the association has continued as a volunteer-only effort," and "..it is time to reinstitute elections of officers."*

As such, the group that circulated the petition made it clear they no longer wanted a “volunteer” association.

The current board called a special meeting that took place on May 26th and the majority attending voted to change the process of our association by voting in favor of elections. 

While board members are technically volunteering their time, we have refrained from using the term “volunteer association” regarding the future board so there would be less confusion, especially since any resident could have simply volunteered at any time for any position in the last several years.

3. For full disclosure purposes, candidates Smith are married.
