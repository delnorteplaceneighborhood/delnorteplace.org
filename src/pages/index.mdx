# Del Norte Place…“In the Heart of the Park”

The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association welcomes you to our active and engaged community of friendly neighbors.

When the first homes were put up for sale in the Del Norte Place subdivision in 1927, they were advertised as “the beautiful subdivision” and “the countryside west of town.” 

With the addition of the Encanto golf courses in 1935 and 1936, Del Norte was now surrounded on three sides by [Encanto Park](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/parks/alphabetical/e-parks/encanto-park), the [Encanto 9-hole Executive Golf Course](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/golf/phoenix-golf-courses/encanto-9) and the [Encanto 18 Hole Championship Course](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/golf/phoenix-golf-courses/encanto-18). It was then advertised as “Del Norte Place…In the Heart of the Park.”

Our founder, Dr. James Collier Norton envisioned a beautiful park-like atmosphere in the middle of the Valley of the Sun. Today you will see Del Norte neighbors enjoying that legacy: walking, biking, and taking advantage of the (mostly) great Phoenix weather and our wide green spaces.

We truly love living in the “Heart of the Park.”

##  Welcome to the Del Norte Place Historic Neighborhood. We hope you will love it here as much as we do! Here are some items of interest, which are also the many benefits to living here!

**“THE HEART OF THE PARK”**: The plot of land that Del Norte Place stands on was originally the Norton Dairy, established in 1912 by Dr. James Collier Norton, after his retirement as Arizona’s last territorial veterinarian. His stately home, the Norton House, still stands proud on 15th Ave. north of Virginia. Dr. Norton began residential development in 1926 from Encanto Blvd. to Vernon Ave. and started selling to the public in 1927. The latter stages of the development, extended from Lewis Ave. up to Virginia Ave. In 1934, he sold the remainder of his land to the City of Phoenix and it became what is now known as the Encanto Golf Course and Encanto Park. Surrounded by lush greenbelts, Del Norte Place was marketed as “The Beautiful Land to the North in the Heart of the Park”.

**DEL NORTE PLACE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION**: The Association is a voluntary, no fee organization that meets every 3rd Thursday evening of the month. The
location of the meeting varies and is often held in a hybrid format in person / virtual platform. For more information regarding the Association and to join the email list please contact DestynMoreno@gmail.com.
**HISTORIC DESIGNATION**: We are proud of our Historic Designation and community residents have an appreciation for preserving the varied architectural styles and landscapes. If you would like more information about the historic neighborhoods and responsibilities of those who live in them please visit the City of Phoenix Preservation Department website at https://www.phoenix.gov/pdd/historic-preservation. Most importantly, if you plan to make changes to the exterior of your home please contact historic@phoenix.gov or by phone at 602-261-8699 to learn more about the process. All exterior changes must be submitted through the Phoenix Historic Preservation Office. Permits may also be required through the city’s zoning department. (Please see attached letter for more detailed information.)
**AZ STATE HISTORIC PROPERTY TAX RECLASSIFICATION FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCE**:
The State Historic Property Tax (SPT) program offers a substantial reduction in the state property tax assessment for eligible owners. This fifteen-year agreement requires maintenance of the property according to federal and Arizona State Parks Board standards and is limited to property used for non-income producing activities. In order to qualify for the SPT program, the property must be listed on the National Register of Historic Places either individually or as a contributor to a historic district. The link for more information and
application process can be found online at the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office. https://azstateparks.com/state-historic-property-tax-reclassification-spt-for-owneroccupied-ho mes

**SHAREHOLDER COMPENSATION**: As a Del Norte Place resident, you are also a Salt River Valley User’s Association shareholder. As such, you may be entitled to compensation for a portion that you paid to Arizona Public Service Company (APS) for electricity the year prior. This is not an automatic rebate; rather, you must submit an application by deadline AND meet the qualification criteria. You have to reapply every year. Qualification Criteria: 1. You owned the eligible land in the year prior 2. Residence was occupied for that entire year. 3. Received APS electrical service in said year (non-experimental, residential rate) 4. Filed an application before the deadline. 5. Paid APS 15% more than would have been paid to SRP for the same amount of electricity in said year. Visit www.srpnet.com/shareholdercomp or call 602-236-8888 for application information.
**RESIDENTIAL PARKING**: Del Norte Place is within the boundaries of the Phoenix Residential Parking Area. Please visit https://www.phoenix.gov/streets/ neighborhood-traffic-programs-services/resident-permit-parking for more information regarding residential street parking. Attached is the City of Phoenix Street Transportation Dept. Resident Permit Application if you choose to purchase a parking permit. Please visit https://www.phoenix.gov/streets/neighborhood-traffic- programs-services/resident-permit-parking for more information.
**GARBAGE & RECYCLE COLLECTION**: Garbage cans (black) are located in the alleyway, and are shared among 2-3 households. Recycle cans (blue) are put out curbside. Both are collected every Friday. We recommend putting recycle cans out early in the morning as pick up is usually completed by 12PM. For more information about bulk trash dates or hazardous waste please contact: Public Works Department at solid.waste@phoenix.gov or 602-262-6251.
**BLOCK WATCH**: In addition to our neighborhood association, many of us are also actively involved in the City of Phoenix Block Watch program. Keep an eye out and report any suspicious activity to Crime Stop 602-262-6151. We can provide a window sign to let others know that you are vigilant.
