# Del Norte Place…”In the Heart of the Park”

The Del Norte Place Neighborhood Association welcomes you to our active and engaged community of friendly neighbors.

When the first homes were put up for sale in the Del Norte Place subdivision in 1927, they were advertised as “the beautiful subdivision” and “the countryside west of town.” 

With the addition of the Encanto golf courses in 1935 and 1936, Del Norte was now surrounded on three sides by Encanto Park, the [Encanto 9-hole Executive Golf Course](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/golf/phoenix-golf-courses/encanto-9) and the [Encanto 18 Hole Championship Course](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/golf/phoenix-golf-courses/encanto-18). It was then advertised as “Del Norte Place…In the Heart of the Park.”

Our founder, Dr. James Collier Norton envisioned a beautiful park-like atmosphere in the middle of the Valley of the Sun. Today you will see Del Norte neighbors enjoying that legacy: walking, biking, and taking advantage of the (mostly) great Phoenix weather and our wide green spaces.

We truly love living in the “Heart of the Park.”
