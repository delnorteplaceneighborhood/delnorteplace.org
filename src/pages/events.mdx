## February Coffee Social

This was the first DNPNA social event in years!  Neighbors gathered, ate from a Local or Nothing food truck, and hung out in the backyard.

# 2020

## Del Norte Place's 93rd Birthday Party

Neighbors gather to celebrate Del Norte Place's birthday, while isolating due to COVID-19.  The party is traditionally at the Norton House, but COVID-19 guidelines, at the time, prevented large gatherings inside.
